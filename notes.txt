components should be able to dispatch actions that get sent to the socket
but where do we store the socket?
we could store it in actions maybe?

i think we should use custom middleware
this is how it will go:
  - the client will be able to join a game and set their current game id to the game's id
  - we attempt to connect to the socket and that socket is stored in actions
  - then we can dispatch any action and also emit to the socket
  - note that we should check if they're connected to the socket before emitting
  - to prevent code duplication, we can put this check in middleware
